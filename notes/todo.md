### TODO:
 * At the start of the game everybody should recieve a json format embeded message with all the necessary character stats to fill out for the game to start. Pin this message.
 * Create a system for console commands
 * Create a system for discord commands
 * Write the backstory
 * Write the actual oneshot down



 ### Ideas
 * Use a hex decimal system for the floor levels in a tower like dungeon 1, 2, 3... 9, a, b, c, d, e, f. With f floors.
 * The party will gradually get new commands as they progress.
 * Give them some powerfull commands but with great costs like exhaustion, strength cost or money cost.
 * At the end they can basically set all their stats to whatever they want.
 * Many level increases
